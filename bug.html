I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly, specifically the `text-red-500` class.  My HTML looked like this: `<p class="text-red-500">This text should be red.</p>`, but the text remained black.  I checked my `tailwind.config.js` file and confirmed that the `red` color palette was included and the purge setting included the relevant component.  Other Tailwind classes were working fine.
